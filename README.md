Users will be presented 5 cards each with a topic. They will be able to select 2, which are kept, the rest are discarded. Game will repeat until all topic cards have been presented. Then the keep pile is shuffled and the process repeats until 8 topics have been selected at least 2 times. These topics are used to populate the axes of the radar graph
